# Instructions : Old MacDonald’s Farm
# Take a look at the following code and output:
# File: market.py

# macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
# macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
# print(macdonald.get_info())
# Output

# McDonald's farm

# cow : 5
# sheep : 2
# goat : 12

#     E-I-E-I-0!


# Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

# Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
# Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
# How many methods does the Farm class need?
# Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
# Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
# Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.
class Farm:
    def __init__(self, farm_name):
        self.name = farm_name
        self.animals = {}
    
    def add_animal(self, animal_type, count=1):
        self.animals[animal_type] = self.animals.get(animal_type,0) + count

    def get_info(self):
        info = f"{self.name}'s farm\n\n"
        for animal_type, count in self.animals.items():
            info += f'{animal_type}: {count}\n'
            info += "\n     E-I-E-I-O!"
            return info
    def get_animal_types(self):
        return sorted(list(self.animals.keys()))
    
    def get_short_info(self):  
        list_keys = self.get_animal_types()
        for animal_type, count in self.animals.items():
            if count > 1 :
                position = list_keys.index(animal_type)
                list_keys[position]  += "s"
                
        animal_types = ", ".join(self.get_animal_types())
        return f"{self.name}'s farm has {animal_types}."
    

# Expand The Farm
# Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].

# Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info. This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheep.”. The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.



# Example usage:
macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
macdonald.add_animal('cow', 5)
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
print(macdonald.get_info())

print(macdonald.get_animal_types()) # Output: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep']
print(macdonald.get_short_info()) # Output: "McDonald's farm has cow, goat, sheep."
